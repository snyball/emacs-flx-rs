# flx-rs
> flx in Rust using dynamic module

The `rust` implementation is under [the-flx/flx-rs](https://github.com/the-flx/flx-rs)
; this repo is a fork of [flx-rs](https://github.com/jcs-elpa/flx-rs) packaged as a
Nix flake.

It's a really bad idea to rely on opaque binaries checked into a git repository,
the goal of this fork is to fix that.

It currently only supports the x86_64-linux target, but support for aarch linux and
Mac OSX may be added at a later stage.

Support for Windows can also be added, albeit only by cross-compiling with Nix.

## üî® Usage

Load by calling the following function,

```el
(flx-rs-load-dyn)
```

Calculate the score with `PATTERN` and `SOURCE`:

```el
(flx-rs-score "something" "some else thing")
```

## üí• Replace `flx`

To completely replace `flx` with this package, add the following line to your
configuration.

```el
(advice-add 'flx-score :override #'flx-rs-score)
```

### üî¨ Build

Use the Nix flake, the package will appear in `./result`.

```
$ nix build
```
